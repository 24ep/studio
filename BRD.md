# Business Requirements Document (BRD) - Candidate Matching ATS

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the business requirements for the Candidate Matching Applicant Tracking System (ATS). The project aims to develop a modern, web-based platform to streamline the recruitment process by efficiently managing candidate information, job positions, and user interactions. The ATS will serve as a central hub for recruiters, hiring managers, and administrators to collaborate and track applicants from initial application to hiring.

## 2. Project Objectives

| Objective                                       | Description                                                                                              |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Develop a functional ATS prototype              | Create a working application demonstrating core ATS functionalities.                                     |
| Streamline Candidate Management                 | Enable efficient tracking, updating, and searching of candidate profiles.                                  |
| Effective Position Management                   | Allow easy creation, modification, and status tracking of job openings.                                    |
| User Role Implementation                        | Support distinct roles (Admin, Recruiter, Hiring Manager) with appropriate access levels.                  |
| Centralized Data                                | Provide a single source of truth for candidate and position information.                                   |
| Improve Recruiter Productivity                  | Reduce manual effort in managing applicants and workflows.                                                 |
| Lay Foundation for AI Features                  | Design the system to potentially integrate AI-powered features like resume parsing and automated matching. |

## 3. Business Needs

The current (hypothetical) recruitment process may suffer from inefficiencies due to scattered information, manual tracking, and lack of a centralized system. This project addresses the need for:
*   A unified platform to manage all recruitment activities.
*   Improved visibility into the candidate pipeline for all stakeholders.
*   Faster processing of applications and candidate progression.
*   Better organization of candidate data, including resumes and interaction history.
*   Enhanced collaboration between recruiters and hiring managers.
*   A secure system for handling sensitive candidate information.
