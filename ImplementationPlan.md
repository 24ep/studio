# Implementation Plan - Candidate Matching ATS

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** {{ CURRENT_DATE }}

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the plan for implementing and deploying the Candidate Matching Applicant Tracking System (ATS) prototype. It covers pre-deployment setup, deployment procedures, post-deployment activities, and considerations for ongoing maintenance, reflecting the system's current features.

### 1.2. Scope
This plan focuses on deploying the application as described in the BRD and SRS documents, utilizing the specified technology stack (Next.js, PostgreSQL, MinIO, Docker).

## 2. Implementation Phases

### 2.1. Phase 1: Pre-Deployment

#### 2.1.1. Environment Setup
*   **Hosting Environment:**
    *   Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Firebase App Hosting, Google Cloud Run, AWS ECS, DigitalOcean Droplet).
    *   Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are available if using a VM-based approach.
*   **Database Server:**
    *   Provision a PostgreSQL instance (e.g., Cloud SQL, RDS, self-hosted).
    *   Ensure network accessibility from the application server.
*   **File Storage:**
    *   Set up a MinIO server or an S3-compatible object storage service.
    *   Ensure network accessibility and create necessary access keys.
*   **Redis Cache (Conceptual):**
    *   If real-time features were to be implemented, provision a Redis instance. (Currently conceptual for this prototype)
*   **Domain & DNS:**
    *   Register a domain name (if applicable for production-like testing).
    *   Configure DNS records to point to the hosting environment.

#### 2.1.2. Configuration Management
*   **Environment Variables:**
    *   Prepare a `.env.production` or equivalent configuration file for the production environment.
    *   Securely manage all secrets (database passwords, API keys, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, MinIO keys, Azure AD credentials).
    *   **Key Variables:**
        *   `DATABASE_URL` (pointing to the production PostgreSQL instance)
        *   `MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `MINIO_PORT`, `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`, `MINIO_BUCKET_NAME`, `MINIO_USE_SSL`
        *   `NEXTAUTH_URL` (the public URL of the application)
        *   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (a strong, unique secret)
        *   `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID` (if Azure AD SSO is used)
        *   `N8N_RESUME_WEBHOOK_URL`, `N8N_GENERIC_PDF_WEBHOOK_URL` (if n8n integration is active)
        *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (if Genkit AI features were to be implemented)
        *   `NODE_ENV=production`
*   **Review `docker-compose.yml`:**
    *   Ensure production-appropriate settings (e.g., remove development volume mounts if building a self-contained image, logging drivers).
    *   Confirm port mappings.

#### 2.1.3. Security Hardening (Basic for Prototype)
*   **HTTPS:** Configure SSL/TLS for the application. Most modern hosting platforms handle this.
*   **Secrets Management:** Use environment variables for all secrets; do not hardcode them.
*   **Firewall:** Restrict access to non-public ports on servers.
*   **Database Security:** Use strong passwords for database users, limit permissions.
*   **MinIO Security:** Use strong access/secret keys for MinIO, secure the console.

### 2.2. Phase 2: Deployment

#### 2.2.1. Build Application
*   **Build Next.js App:**
    *   Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to create a production build of the Next.js application.
*   **Build Docker Image:**
    *   Ensure `Dockerfile` is optimized for production (e.g., multi-stage builds).
    *   Build the Docker image: `docker build -t candidate-matching-app:latest .` (or use `docker-compose build app`).
    *   Push the image to a container registry if deploying to a managed container service (e.g., GCR, Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

#### 2.2.2. Deploy Services
*   **Database:**
    *   Ensure the PostgreSQL server is running and accessible.
    *   The `pg-init-scripts/init-db.sql` script will be executed by the PostgreSQL container on its first startup if the data volume is empty. This creates tables (including `SystemSetting`, `ResumeHistory`, `NotificationEvent`, etc.) and the default admin user.
    *   **Verify `init-db.sql` execution:** Check PostgreSQL container logs.
*   **MinIO:**
    *   Deploy the MinIO service (e.g., via Docker Compose or managed service).
    *   The application will attempt to create the specified bucket (`MINIO_BUCKET_NAME`) on startup if it doesn't exist (see `src/lib/minio.ts`).
*   **Application:**
    *   Deploy the application container (e.g., using `docker-compose up -d` for a single server, or via a container orchestration service).
    *   Ensure environment variables are correctly passed to the application container.

#### 2.2.3. Initial System Checks
*   **Connectivity:**
    *   Verify the application can connect to the PostgreSQL database (check application logs for "Successfully connected...").
    *   Verify the application can connect to MinIO (check application logs for "Successfully connected..." or bucket creation messages).
*   **Basic Functionality:**
    *   Access the application via its public URL.
    *   Attempt login with the default admin credentials (`admin@ncc.com` / `nccadmin` or as changed in `init-db.sql`).

### 2.3. Phase 3: Post-Deployment

#### 2.3.1. System Verification & Smoke Testing
*   Log in as the default admin.
*   **Immediately change the default admin password.**
*   Perform basic CRUD operations:
    *   Create a new user, assign roles/permissions/groups.
    *   Create a new position, add custom fields if defined.
    *   Create a new candidate, assign to the position, upload a dummy resume and profile image.
    *   Change candidate status, check transition history.
*   Verify settings pages load (Preferences, Recruitment Stages, User Groups, Custom Fields, Webhook Mapping, Notification Settings, Data Model Preferences).
*   Test log viewing, filtering, and search.
*   Check application logs for any startup errors or warnings.

#### 2.3.2. User Account Setup & Training
*   Create accounts for initial users (Recruiters, Hiring Managers, other Admins).
*   Assign appropriate roles, permissions, and group memberships.
*   Provide training documentation or sessions to users on how to use the ATS.

#### 2.3.3. Monitoring & Logging
*   **Application Logs:** Regularly review application logs (accessible via UI for Admins, or server logs) for errors and audit trails.
*   **System Monitoring:** Set up basic server/service monitoring (CPU, memory, disk space, network traffic) if self-hosting. Managed services often provide this.
*   **Uptime Monitoring:** Use an external service to monitor application uptime.

#### 2.3.4. Backup Strategy
*   **Database Backups:**
    *   Configure regular automated backups for the PostgreSQL database (e.g., daily snapshots).
    *   Test backup restoration periodically.
*   **MinIO Backups:**
    *   Configure backups for MinIO data (resumes, avatars, files) if critical. Options include MinIO's `mc mirror` or filesystem-level backups of the MinIO data volume.
    *   Test restoration.

### 2.4. Phase 4: Ongoing Maintenance

*   **Software Updates:** Regularly update Next.js, Node.js, operating system, database, and other dependencies.
*   **Security Patches:** Apply security patches promptly.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor application performance and identify bottlenecks.
*   **Log Review & Auditing:** Periodically review audit logs and system logs.
*   **User Feedback:** Collect user feedback for future improvements.
*   **Scalability:** Plan for scaling resources if user load increases significantly (beyond prototype scope).
