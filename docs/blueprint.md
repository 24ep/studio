## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of trust and professionalism, which are essential for an HR application.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F7), almost white, provides a clean, neutral backdrop that ensures readability and focuses attention on content.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00BCD4) to highlight key interactive elements. This encourages user interaction without being too distracting.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts (like Open Sans) for all text elements.
- Consistent use of a modern, minimalist icon set across the application.
- Use a grid-based layout to maintain consistency and alignment across all pages.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins, transitions) to provide feedback on user interactions.
